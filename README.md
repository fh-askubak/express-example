## Express API
<p>This project was to refresh my familiarity with the node.js framework, specifically Express.</p>

<p>This express api connects to a local MongoDB instance.</p>

## To Get Started
<p>After cloning the repository, you will want to install the required dependencies with <code>npm install</code></p>
<p>To start the server, simply run <code>npm start</code> and you can find it running on <code>localhost:4000</code></p>

## Looking Forward
<p>I would love to work out serving a React application to consume the express api. I found a few tutorials to try out but will have to see if I have the time available to implement it with this project.</p>

## Testing
<p>I was able to write two unit tests using Mocha but ran into issues getting the integration test to work. I've written tests before in JUnit, so it was nice to get some unit testing exposure within the node framework.</p>
